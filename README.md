#An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
---
#Purpose
* Cleanup and sort through the crowdfunding data to find any trends and gather information into how different factors change campaign results including time of year and amount of money donated. Looking at success and failure percentages as well as funding for campaigns. Using filters, conditional formatting, charts, and pivot tables.
* Take the information found and be able to present it in a clear and easy to read format to show trends for Louise to assist in their decision making for a future campaign/play.

## Analysis and Challenges

* Condensed information using filters to make pivot tables and charts to create visuals showing results for successful, failed, and canceled events over the span of 12 years.

* Used the countif function to show the number of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns there were with different ranges from less than 1,000 to 50,000 or more. Within in that same chart found the percentage rate of each. Created a line chart to show visual of findings.

* Challenges encountered was while working with the countif function. It was my first time using it and when setting up the function I found myself having trouble getting the original formula correct. Once I did it was an easy process to spread across the sheet.

## Results

-What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
*Two conclusions that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by Launch date would be that May - June show to be the most successful months. Cancellation rates across the year are low with the most being in January.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* The highest success rate is 75.81% with a goal less than 1,000 but if you wanted a larger budget the success rate for $35,000 - $44,999 is 66.67%, once you pass the $44,999 mark your failure rate is at its highest point of 87.50%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
* Some limitations within the data is going to be funding outside of the kickstart campaign. How would outside sources or even personal finances influence rates? Another limitation would be what cities are these being launched in? A small town with a $1,000 budget or larger cities with larger budget potential?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
* Could also create graphs showing the successful, failed, and canceled percentages to help show Louise the potential in other areas. Can also take the numbers of other countries to see how their trends compare to those in the US.
